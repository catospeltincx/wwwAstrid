            Astrid De Haes (Belgium, 1996) is living and working in Antwerp. De
            Haes started dancing at the age of 6 and has had a big interest in
            moving and the body ever since.

            Captivated by dance and eager for experiment, De Haes took a
            bachelor’s and master’s degree in Visual Arts, Autonomous Design, at
            the School of Arts in Ghent. To become proficient in choreography,
            she enjoyed an internship at the School for New Dance Development at
            the Amsterdam School of the Arts in 2017. In her bachelor's degree
            she made connections between different mediums and the body, which
            can be seen in ‘Hommes’ (video), ‘Dansbingo’ (performative play
            between audience and performers), Volume I (installation), etc.

          <p>
            In her masters she developed as a director and choreographer with
            the preliminary research for the dance performance ‘Untitled’.
            Interested in bringing people together in a project, there is always
            a focus on the moving body as a creative medium.
