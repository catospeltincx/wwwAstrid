    <div class="about">
      <p class="brood">
        Astrid De Haes (Belgium, 1996) is living and working in Antwerp. De Haes
        started dancing at the age of 6 and has had a big interest in moving and
        the body ever since.
      </p>

      <p class="brood">
        Captivated by dance and eager for experiment, De Haes took a bachelor’s
        and master’s degree in Visual Arts, Autonomous Design, at the School of
        Arts in Ghent. To become proficient in choreography, she enjoyed an
        internship at the School for New Dance Development at the Amsterdam
        School of the Arts in 2017. In her bachelor's degree she made
        connections between different mediums and the body, which can be seen in
        ‘Hommes’ (video), ‘Dansbingo’ (performative play between audience and
        performers), Volume I (installation), etc.
      </p>

      <p class="brood">
        In her masters she developed as a director and choreographer with the
        preliminary research for the dance performance ‘Untitled’. Interested in
        bringing people together in a project, there is always a focus on the
        moving body as a creative medium.
      </p>

      <p class="brood">
        Astrid lives in Van Bree, a creative hub in Antwerp that regularly hosts
        Van Bree sessions on Sundays throughout the year. Artists who have
        already performed in 2022 include Brenda, Bontridders, Hoffman, Viva Los
        Djs, Dylan Cox, Noonzy, Orlan, Floridada,...
      </p>

      <p class="brood">
        In addition to her own practice, Astrid is also active as a business and
        production manager for other companies and creators.
      </p>

      <p class="brood">
        De Haes is active as a director, choreographer, cultural and business
        manager. Bringing people together and collaborating with a group is a
        must in Astrid’s work.
