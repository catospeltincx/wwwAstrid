            Try to imagine that we as humans could exchange places with the
            earth. Would we then see how humans could perhaps do it better? And
            if the earth was in our shoes, would she understand that it is not
            all that easy to solve the problems? Would she see us trying?

            This solo performance started with the belief that the solution of
            the climate crisis can be found in what we already have and how we
            can be creative with that. There is plenty enough already, but also
            too much. We see this performance as one example of how we can
            approach things: by looking at what is already present and
            using/approaching these things in a new way (each time). We do this
            by offering a new perspective and making elements that are already
            existing interesting again. By giving objects a different connection
            to each other in the space and by changing, repeating or reshuffling
            the order of movements, we can allow new meanings to appear. Maybe
            that's where we find the answers.

            We see this performance as an attempt to make people active on the
            climate crisis, but mostly to allow the audience to calmly indulge
            in an evening without too much pressure. What to do and how to do
            the right things is complex and most of the time confusing. We can
            very easily punish ourselves but somehow we have to give it a try,
            together
